<h1>COLLECT: the Concurrent Collection Verifier</h1>

<p> COLLECT is finite-state verification tool for concurrent data
structures that implement standard collections, such as sets and
queues.  It is built on top of the <a href="https://civl.dev">CIVL
Model Checker</a>.  Given a concurrent collection implemented in the
CIVL-C language, and parameters that specify small bounds on the
number of threads, number of method calls, and other parameters,
COLLECT explores the reachable states of the program.  It is able to
check standard consistency properties within these bounds, such as
sequential consistency, linearizability, or quiescent consistency.</p>

<p> This web site also presents the results of an on-going case study
applying COLLECT to the data structures from the widely-used text, <a
href="https://shop.elsevier.com/books/the-art-of-multiprocessor-programming/herlihy/978-0-12-415950-1">The
Art of Multiprocessor Programming</a>, by Maurice Herlihy, Nir Shavit,
Victor Luchangco, and Michael Spear.  At this point, we have analyzed
all 20 structures in the chapters on Lists, Queues, Hash Sets, and
Priority Queues (chapters 9, 10, 13, and 15).  We have verified many
of these structures within various small scopes, and found several
subtle and previously unknown defects in others.
