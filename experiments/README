	     COLLECT: the Concurrent Collection Verifier

This is the experiments directory containing the implementations of concurrent
collection classes from "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming", 2nd ed.,
created as a case study demonstrating COLLECT.

This directory contains the following:

  src/ : The concurrent collection implementations, sorted under subdirectories
         by type (lists, queues, pqueues, hashsets).

  results/ : Contains the destination for experiment outputs (results/out), as
             well as results_parser.py, which can generate HTML or LaTeX tables
             of the results.

  Makefile : The core Makefile for the project.

  common.mk : The shared definitions used for the Makefile and .mk files.

  *.mk : The specific Makefiles for each collection type.


Several useful rules for running experiments are listed below:

  make
   - runs all experiments for configurations A through D.

  make config_A
   - runs all the experiments using configuration A, the smallest set of bounds.

  make bugs
   - runs only the experiment cases that reproduce a violation.

  make test
   - runs the short test cases provided for each implementation.
