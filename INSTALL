          COLLECT: Installation Instructions

This repository contains the source code for the COLLECT Verifier as
well as CIVL-C implementations of data structures from *The Art of
Multiprocessor Programming*.

Instructions:

First, you will need a recent version of the Java SDK (version 17 or
higher), and GNU Make.  Install these if you don't already have them.

Second, install the latest (unstable) release of the CIVL model
checker following the instructions here:

http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/lib/sw/civl/trunk/latest/release/index.html


Next, download and unpack the COLLECT distribution and move it
to wherever you like on your local system.

Move into the root directory of the distribution.  Make a copy of
config/config_default.mk called config/config.mk and edit as
appropriate to provide system-specific information.

Type "make".  This should compile COLLECT and run some simple tests on
a number of data structures.

To run more extensive tests, see the individual make files
hashsets.mk, lists.mk, queues.mk, and pqueues.mk.  Each has comments
and a number of rules to run different sized configurations.
